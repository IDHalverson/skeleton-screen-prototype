# Skeleton View Example

Start the server by running `npm run start` from this directory.

Run `npm run watch` in order to have the `insert-skeleton-script.js` script run automatically when you make changes.

You may need to do `npm i -g npm-watch` to install `npm-watch` globally before everything will work.

With the `child_process` module, it is possible to create a separate script so that `npm run start` and `npm run watch` always happen together and both processes log their output to the console. I have done this one time before.
